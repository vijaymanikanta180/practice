Variables:
1. Assume that you have 10 Servers with Two Groups like below Inventory file

[Webservers]
WS1
WS2
WS3
WS4
WS5

{AppServers]
AS1
AS2
AS3
AS4
AS5

you wanted to install httpd package on all 4 Servers WS1 - WS4 and Wanted to install nano Editor package in WS5. Your YAML file looks like the below
main.yaml
---
- hosts: Webservers
 become: yes
 tasks:
 - name: install web server
 yum:
   name:  "{{webserver_package}}"
   state: present

You are going to create two folders
1. group_vars
The file name is Webservers and the content nside it is
---
  webserver_package: httpd

2. host_vars
The file name is WS5 and the content inside it is

---
  webserver_package: nano

Example 2: 
main.yaml
---
  - hosts: all
    tasks:
    - name: Just checking Group Variables
      debug:
       msg: "{{log_folder}}"

group_vars --> folder
Webservers --> file
---
  log_folder: "/home/ansible/groupvars/logs"

host_vars--> folder
hostname --> file
---
  log_folder: "/home/ansible/hostvars/logs"
